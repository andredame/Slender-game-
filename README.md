# JAVA GAME - CAR CRASHED

**Description:**
You were on your way to the programmer's convention, passing through the haunted forest, when suddenly a snake crosses the road. Now, you find yourself stranded in the forest after a car crash into a tree. Your only way out is to locate all the car parts scattered around the forest floor so you can continue your journey to the programmer's convention. But be cautious â€“ snakes lurk in the shadows, ready to strike. To interact with objects in the forest, press (E).

**Development Context:**
This project was developed in the context of the "Fundamentals of Parallel and Distributed Processes" course at PUCRS (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul). The main goal was to create a Java game utilizing multiple threads.

**Credits:**
Some assets and aspects of the camera design were incorporated from a YouTube tutorial series available at [YouTube Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq).
